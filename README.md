Hello everyone.

I have had the habit of writing a diary every day for the past two or three years, but I haven't been doing it very well.

So today,I decided to create a new repository and use English to record my diary.

I know this is not an easy work,but base on a morning routine video I watched on Bilibili yesterday, I have decided to wake up a 5am every day from now on.

After waking up,I will study vocabulary and write in my diary,If I stick with this routine,I believe that my English level will definitely improve.

This is just the begging of my new habit formation. 
I just need to go ahead and do it.
