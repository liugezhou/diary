Last night We played mahjong until 5'clock in the morning.

This morning, my classmate aliya wasn't feeling well,and when she took her temperature,it had spiked to 39.2 degrees Celsius.She took ibuprofen an noon and in the evening.

In the afternoon,we both rested for a while,and in the evening we ordered takeout and I quickly finished my weekly report before going to bed early.

Getting enough sleep is really important for one's mental state.

Some reflections on today:
1. Physical heath can be easily overlooked in daily life,and it's important to respond promptly when feeling unwell.
2. Meditation is great and should be gradually integrated into ours life
3. Maintaining a clam mind at all times is a wonderful thing.
