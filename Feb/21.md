I woke up at 6am and studied English vocabulary for a while.
I left at 7:20am and arrived at company round 9:20am, with a 2 hour commute. 
It was my first dat at work and the office environment was quite basic,but the founder's idea and passion were very inspiring to me.  
I wasn't originally planning to  taking this job,but I felt I should challenge myself,and with the current job market being so tough,I should make the best of it.
