This morning, while studying English vocabulary On 扇贝，I had a chat with ChatGPT while I was memorizing words.  
I asked ChatGPT how to learn English,and he gave me suggestions on listening,speaking,writing and reading.  
Regarding writing,he suggested stating with an English Diary,short stories,or exchanging letters with a pen pal.

1. What is the inner drive and meaning of writing a diary every day?
  - To record life,thoughts,and memories. From a grand perspective,when I am old, I don't want to feel that I waste my time.  Recording events seems very important,but from a micro perspective,the meaning of recording is just for self growth. What happened today,what I pay attention to ,and what experience I gained.
  - Of course,it can cause mental exhaustion,but it can also gradually cultivate a more positive attitude.
  - Recoding through a Github repository is a goog way to do it.

2. Should I start cultivating the habit of writing English diary immediately?

    - Without a doubt,it can improve my English proficiency.
    - It is friendly to make note in Chinese first and then complete it in English. This reminds me of the female protagonist's compulsory class in "天道" every night. 
    - Record in a social or public way.
    - Use ChatGPT to help with translation.
    - Of course,after the translation is completed by ChatGPT,it is important to manually review and edit it before starting to use it.
